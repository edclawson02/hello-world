Hi Humans, 

Edward Here, I am a proud new father of a 4 week year old boy. I am a first generation college graduate and I am currently working towards my M.S. in Computer Science: Data Science. I plan to work in the bioinformatics sector or pursue my PhD upon completion of my Masters in Computational Biology. All this is subject to what God has in store for me, but as long as he allows it that will be my future.
